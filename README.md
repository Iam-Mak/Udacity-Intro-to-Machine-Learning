## What is Machine Learning?

Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. 

- **Arthur Samuel** described it as: *"the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.*

- **Tom Mitchell** provides a more modern definition: *"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."* <br />
Example: playing checkers.
    - E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
    - T = the task of playing checkers.
    - P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

### Classic definition
Machine learning is a data science technique used to extract patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data, and forecast future outcomes, behaviors, and trends.
